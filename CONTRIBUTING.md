### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Follow the existing code style**
5. **Write clear commit messages**

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/jumbojett/zsh-autosuggestions-plugin.git
cd zsh-autosuggestions-plugin

## Code Style

- Use **descriptive variable names**
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Follow **existing formatting** (2-space indentation)
- Use **zsh best practices**:
  - `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for conditionals
  - `(( ))` for arithmetic
  - `local` for function-scoped variables
  - Proper quoting of variables

## Testing

Manual testing checklist:

- [ ] Suggestions appear when typing
- [ ] Suggestions are gray/dimmed
- [ ] Tab accepts suggestion
- [ ] Right arrow accepts suggestion at end of line
- [ ] Up arrow cycles through suggestions
- [ ] Down arrow cycles back
- [ ] Cursor navigation works normally
- [ ] Works with Oh My Zsh (if applicable)
- [ ] No errors in terminal

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
