- **‚Üì (Down Arrow)**: Cycle to newer suggestions

Type `git` and see suggestions:- **‚Üë‚Üì with empty line**: Normal history navigation (unchanged)

```bash

$ git‚ñà              # Shows: git status (in gray)## Usage Examples

```

1. **Type a common command:**

Press ‚Üë to cycle:   ```

```bash   $ gi‚ñà

$ git‚ñà              # Shows: git push (in gray)   ```

$ git‚ñà              # Shows: git pull (in gray)   You might see: `git status` in gray

   ```

Edit these settings in `zsh-autosuggestions.zsh`:

4. **Accept word-by-word with Ctrl+‚Üí:**

### Change Suggestion Color   ```

   $ git‚ñà  ‚Üí  $ git status‚ñà  ‚Üí  $ git status --short‚ñà

```bash   ```

# Default gray

typeset -g ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=8'## Customization



# Other options:Edit the configuration section in `zsh-autosuggestions.zsh`:

# fg=240  - Darker gray

# fg=244  - Medium gray```bash

# fg=248  - Lighter gray# Change suggestion color (currently gray)

# fg=cyan,dim - Dimmed cyanZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=8'     # Try: fg=240, fg=244, etc.

```

# Maximum number of suggestions to cache

### Maximum Suggestions to Cache# (currently set to 10, increase for more cycling options)

head -n 10  # Change this number in the _zsh_autosuggest_fetch_suggestion function

Find this line in `_zsh_autosuggest_fetch_suggestion` function:```



```bash### Available Colors

(( ${#matches[@]} >= 10 )) && break  # Change 10 to your preferred number

```Try different gray shades by changing `fg=8`:

- `fg=8` - Default gray

## Compatibility- `fg=240` - Darker gray

- `fg=244` - Medium gray  

- **Zsh**: 5.0 or higher- `fg=248` - Lighter gray

- **macOS**: ‚úÖ Fully tested- `fg=cyan,dim` - Dimmed cyan

- **Linux**: ‚úÖ Should work- `fg=blue,dim` - Dimmed blue

- **Windows (WSL)**: ‚úÖ Should work

## Troubleshooting

Works with:

- Oh My Zsh### Suggestions not appearing?

- Prezto1. Make sure you have command history: `history | head`

- Plain zsh2. Try typing a command you've used before

3. Check that the plugin loaded: should see "‚úì ZSH Auto-Suggestions loaded" message

## Troubleshooting

### Conflicts with other plugins?

### Suggestions not appearing?If you use other zsh plugins (like oh-my-zsh), load this plugin AFTER them:



1. Check your history exists:```bash

   ```bash# ~/.zshrc order:

   history | headsource ~/.oh-my-zsh/oh-my-zsh.sh  # Or other plugin managers

   ```# ... other plugins ...

source ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh  # Load this last

2. Try typing a command you've used before```



3. Look for the success message when loading:### Arrow keys not working?

   ```The plugin preserves normal arrow key behavior:

   ‚úì ZSH Auto-Suggestions loaded- ‚Üë‚Üì with empty line = history navigation (normal)

   ```- ‚Üë‚Üì with text at end of line = cycle suggestions (new feature)

- ‚Üê‚Üí = cursor movement (normal) + accept suggestion when at end (new)

### Conflicts with other plugins?

## Uninstalling

Load this plugin **after** other plugins in your `~/.zshrc`:

Remove the source line from your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash

source ~/.oh-my-zsh/oh-my-zsh.sh  # Load framework first```bash

# ... other plugins ...# Comment out or delete this line:

source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh  # Load this last# source ~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh

``````



### Arrow keys not working?Then reload:

```bash

The plugin preserves normal behavior:source ~/.zshrc

- ‚Üë‚Üì with **empty line** = normal history navigation```

- ‚Üë‚Üì with **text at end** = cycle through suggestions

- ‚Üê‚Üí = normal cursor movement## Comparison with suggest.sh



## Uninstalling| Feature | suggest.sh (Proof of Concept) | zsh-autosuggestions.zsh (Real Integration) |

|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|

Remove the source line from your `~/.zshrc`:| Shell Integration | Separate pseudo-shell | Native zsh integration |

| History | Reads history files | Uses zsh's built-in history |

```bash| Performance | Good | Excellent (native zle) |

# Remove or comment out:| Compatibility | Works in any shell | zsh only |

# source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh| Key Bindings | Custom handlers | Native zsh bindings |

```| Use Case | Testing/demo | Daily use |



Then reload:## Next Steps

```bash

source ~/.zshrc1. **Test it**: `source zsh-autosuggestions.zsh` in your terminal

```2. **Try it out**: Type some commands and experiment with the keys

3. **Customize**: Adjust the color and behavior to your liking

## How It Works4. **Make it permanent**: Add to your `~/.zshrc` when satisfied



This plugin integrates with zsh's line editor (ZLE) by:Enjoy your fish-style auto-suggestions in zsh! üêü‚û°Ô∏èüîß


1. **Wrapping widgets** - Intercepts keyboard input via ZLE widgets
2. **Searching history** - Uses zsh's built-in `$history` array
3. **Display via POSTDISPLAY** - Shows suggestions using zsh's `POSTDISPLAY` variable
4. **Highlighting** - Applies gray color using `region_highlight`
5. **Hook system** - Uses `line-pre-redraw` to maintain display across redraws
